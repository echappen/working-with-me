# Working With Me

You know that time at the beginning of a job when everything's brand new? There have been times when I wish I had a quick briefing on someone's personality and working style, so I could be more prepared, make fewer mistakes, and shorten that length of time from brand new employee to fully onboarded contributor.

To that end, think of this doc as your briefing on what it's like to work with me. Obviously we'll get to know each other better over time, this is just a start :)

## About this Doc
- I believe this could be useful for anyone who is my coworker, manager, or direct report.
- This document applies only to me.
- I like to provide this information so you can hold me accountable. If you ever see a discrepancy between what's here and my behavior, _please_ tell me.
- If you work with me, you intentionally have edit rights to this document.

## About Me

I've been a professional software developer for over five years (my technical abilities are below). I'm based in Chicago, Illinois. My pronounse are she/her.

The main career goal is to do work and develop relationships that are meaningful, interesting, and impactful. In order to do this, I want to build a strong foundation of technical knowledge that goes beyond specific frameworks or trends.

One of my goals is to become a better technical and non-technical communicator. I enjoy having the opportunity to write things like documentation, blog posts, and other public material. I'd like to do more talks and presentations.

Things I like:
- Working with kind and driven people
- Being useful
- Learning opportunities

Things I don't like:
- Inefficiency
- Over-pivoting of priorities

## Communication

I prefer to err on the side of overcommunication, especially for remote work.

Despite working with computers for a living, I'm actually not the best typist, so I prefer verbal conversations over typed ones.

I respond to email a few designated times per day. If it's urgent and we're in the office, let's talk in person. Working remotely, video chat or phonecall is best.

If I'm working on something and would like your input, I will often comment or chat you (even if we're nearby). I try to do that so that things are documented for the future and so that you can finish what you're doing first.

To improve concentration, I take a lot of hand-written notes and avoid bringing my computer into in-person meetings.

In tense situations, like fixing an urgent bug or deploying a major release, I prefer to stay calm. I'm a socially-reserved and relatively unemotive person by nature. In the past, some have interpreted this as shyness, timidity, boredom, or lack of enthusiasm. I promise you I'm none of these things! I don't say this as an excuse to seem standoffish or rude. If I ever come off this way, please tell me.

## Technical

The frameworks I know best are Ruby on Rails, React.js, and their most common related packages. Most of my professional experience is in relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. I'm comfortable writing raw SQL and actually enjoy it.

I've ping-ponged back and forth between Ruby and Javascript projects pretty much my whole career. As a result, my Ruby writing feels a little Javascript-y and my Javascript feels a little Ruby-ish. I use linters and formatters in both worlds to prevent this from being a problem.

### You can lean on me to:
- brainstorm modeling and architecture decisions
- tease out a hairy SQL query
- think through tech implications of a design/UX decision, and vice versa
- build an API that both clients and humans can understand
- write technical (or non-technical) blog posts
- figure out how to properly test a feature
- lead retrospectives and other meetings

### My growth areas are:
- front-end performance enhancement and monitoring
- system administration
- learning how to use Docker in non-trivial ways
- Graphql
- public speaking

## Feedback

Giving and receiving feedback can be really hard to do well, but if we're going to succeed as a team, we must be unafraid and eager to talk openly. I'm willing to do what it takes to help us achieve this.

I believe the best feedback is measured, specific, and actionable. I also think good feedback is aimed at external behavior over innate qualities ("you _did_ this" as opposed to "you _are_ this").

In line with my regular communication style, I like doing feedback in-person/verbally, because it's hard to pick up on tone in a typed message.

If possible, I prefer receiving feedback retroactively instead of in the moment. I find it a bit difficult to process feedback while trying to do something else. That said, I'd rather have you tell me something than not tell me.

I will do my best to give feedback in your preferred method. I also try to remember that praise is just as important as critical feedback.

## Other Stuff

I'm slowly learning Spanish, still not very good at it :/

If you've read a book or seen a good movie lately, I want to hear about it!

If you've traveled to a cool place lately (once we can travel again), I want to hear about it!
