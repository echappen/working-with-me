# Working With Me

You know that time at the beginning of a job when everything's brand new? New physical space, new commute, new tasks, new boss, new coworkers. Not only are you trying to get up to speed on your actual job and your new pace of life, but you're also getting to know the people in your office. Who prefers email over Slack? Who welcomes feedback? Who likes company at the lunch table? There have been times when I wish I had a quick briefing of someone's personality and working style, so I could be more prepared, make fewer mistakes, and shorten that period from brand new employee to fully onboarded contributor. 

So to that end, think of this doc as your briefing on what it's like to work with me. Obviously we'll get to know each other better over time, which I look forward to doing!

## About this Doc
- I believe this document could be useful for anyone who is my coworker, manager, or direct report. 
- This document applies only to me and in no way should be applied to any other person.
- I like to provide this information so you can hold me accountable. If you ever see a discrepancy between what's here and my behavior, _please_ tell me.
- If you work with me, you intentionally have edit rights to this document.

## Values and Motivations

## Communication

In order of most to least preferred, my communication preferences are:

1. In person (or video chat if you're remote)
2. Slack message
3. Phonecall
4. Text Message
5. Email

I generally respond to email a few designed times per day. 

I prefer straight talk over glad-handing or beating around the bush. 

I will try my best to not discuss work topics outside of work (this includes lunchtime), unless you want to. I'm a big believer in having healthy work/life partitions, and in no way do I interpret this as a lack of dedication to your job.

I will always welcome company at the lunch table, even when it looks like I'm busy on my phone. My Twitter browsing is nowhere near as important or interesting as chatting with you. 

## Feedback

I greatly value giving and getting feedback, because it's a chance for me to do better and to learn more about the people I work with. I believe the best feedback is timely, specific and actionable. Good feedback is also aimed at behavior over qualities ("you _did_ this" as opposed to "you _are_ this").

Productive feedback cycles are reliant on:
- **Safety**: One must feel safe to speak openly and honestly, without fear of an emotional response or negative repercussion.
- **Impact**: One must believe that their feedback will be acted upon genuinely by the individual or group receiving it.
- **Ease**: Giving feedback should be frictionless and not feel like a burden. It should be easy. 

## Interpersonal

- I'm a socially-reserved and relatively unemotive person by nature. In the past, some have interpreted this as shyness, modesty, boredom, or lack of enthusiasm.  I promise you I'm none of these things. I don't say this as an excuse to seem standoffish or rude. If I ever come off this way, please tell me.

- No, I do not watch Game of Thrones. 

- My favorite TV show is The Great British Bakeoff.
